    What is the fourth dimension? What does it mean for there to be another?

    First, let's explain what a dimension is. In essence, a dimension is just a direction. Imagine a man living on a line:

    [image here of a stick figure man standing on a line with an arrow in each direction]

    He can move either left or right on the line. We can understand this means he has one direction; the line is one-dimensional. Formally, any position on the line can be described with a single number. We can call that position on the line x.


    Now, imagine we give him a ladder that he can move along his line.

    [image here of the stick figure man saying ‘yay’ with the ladder on the arrow]

    He can now move left and right, and up and down. There are two directions; he can now move two-dimensionally. To describe any one position now, we need two numbers, x like before, as well as a new number y to show his ‘height’ on the ladder.


    This should all feel very familiar, as you’ve seen 2d graphs like this 
    in every math class for as long as you can remember. How does this help 
    us understand 4d objects? Well, consider how Oliver (that’s his name now!) 
    thinks about you. Yes, you! Looking at him on the screen, you're viewing him
    from another direction, which we can call the z axis (an 'axis' just means a direction).
    He can't turn towards the screen, so from his perspective you don't exist. However, what
    happens if you put your hand next to your screen?

    [image here of a hand on the side of a laptop screen, with a picture of stick figure man on it]
    Come on, do it! Really!


    You're not flat, but Oliver can still see the part of your hand that intersects with the area
    he can see, which is the flat plane of the screen. Imagining the intersection of your finger
    and the plane, you can see it's just something like a circle. We call this the cross-section
    of the plane and the finger.

    [image here of the laptop screen being extended to the finger, and the intersecting circle being drawn out]

    Let's say we want to show Oliver what a cube is
    (you could use a more complex shape, but the math will get harder).

    How could we do it? Well, imagine we take a magic floating cube next to the screen. If we
    move it fully from one side to the other, Oliver could see the whole thing, just through the
    individual cross-sections.

    ...but to him, what would it look like? Try to figure it out on your own before continuing.
    [page break here]
    [simulation with a plane and a cube placed towards the screen. there is a slider which controls the cube's z position. the intersection of the two geometries is drawn separately]

    It's a square. It makes sense; the cube is aligned to the plane, so when the cube enters or leaves
    the plane, all levels of the cube at that z-level enter/leave at the same time. Mathematically,
    we can see this by looking at the equation of the cube and plane. If we imagine Oliver's house
    to be the origin (where x, y, and z = 0) and the cube to be a 'unit cube' where 
    the side length = 1, then we can say the plane is defined as
    
    z = 0

    and the cube is defined as
    -0.5 <= x <= 0.5
    -0.5 <= y <= 0.5
    -0.5 <= z <= 0.5

    so, to find the cross-section we can just plug the z value from the first equation to the second:
    
    -0.5 <= x <= 0.5
    -0.5 <= y <= 0.5

    and, this is the equation of a square. Perfect!
    

    Now, let's get back to the point. What is the fourth dimension? First, extend your knowledge
    from the prior exercise to your own world-- the real world. You are Oliver.

    What does that mean? Well, try to imagine our entire universe-- everything, everywhere--
    exists on a flat, three-dimensinoal 'hyperplane' (plane is specific to 2D).
    Now, there are still our three axes (x y and z), but there is also a fourth one, which we
    can call w. As Oliver, you can't turn towards w, but you can still understand it's there
    by extending your knowledge of how a 2D creature might exist in a 3D world.

    But, bad news; the magic floating unit cube is back, and now it has another dimension!
    Now, instead of just being a cube, it's a 4D hypercube, also called a tesseract. Rather than
    a cube, which is made up of six squares, or a square, which is made up of 4 lines, a tesseract
    is made of 8 cubes. 
    
    Do you see the pattern? [on click: try to figure out why. how do you construct a cube from squares, or a square from lines?]

    Mathematically, it can be described as 

    -0.5 <= x <= 0.5
    -0.5 <= y <= 0.5
    -0.5 <= z <= 0.5
    -0.5 <= w <= 0.5

    So... what would you see? What object would appear in front of you as the hypercube moved through
    the w-axis?
    
    [page break here]
    [simulation which shows the intersection of a hypercube and a 3d plane. there is a slider which controls the cube's w position. the intersection of the two geometries is drawn in the center of the screen]

    You probably could've seen this coming, but it's a cube. Setting w to zero with the same logic we used earlier,
    you can see the cross-section is 

    -0.5 <= x <= 0.5
    -0.5 <= y <= 0.5
    -0.5 <= z <= 0.5

    as you can probably tell, this is the equation of a cube. Perfect.


    So, great. We can make cubes appear and disappear. But what about the *fourth dimension*?
    All those cool gifs of weird rotating geometries labeled tesseracts? What about those?

    Well, first let's revisit Oliver.

    [image of Oliver waving hi]

    You might have noticed an issue with our earlier 'simulations' of the intersections.
    It assumes that the cubes are always aligned perfectly with the planes. But, what if that's not the case?

    [image of the cube next to Oliver's plane, now rotated 45 degrees around each axis so one vertex is facing the plane]

    this is the same cube, rotated 45 degrees around each axis. Imagine what Oliver would see now, as the
    plane moves through the z-axis. Try to figure it out, and then test your thoughts:

    [simulation with a plane and the rotated cube placed towards the screen. there is a slider which controls the cube's z position. the intersection of the two geometries is drawn separately]

    first, there is a single point, which grows into a triangle, then grows into more complex shapes,
    before shrinking back into a triangle, then to a point, then disappearing.

    Just looking at the shape of the rotated cube, it makes sense; the plane first intersects the tip,
    then intersects along the pyramidical section of the cube, then begins reaching the other edges
    of the cube which add more complex sides, until it reaches the midpoint; and then begins shrinking
    on the other side, which is opposite to the first.

    How about the math, though? [on click:
        First, we know the cube can be represented as 
        
        -0.5 <= x <= 0.5
        -0.5 <= y <= 0.5
        -0.5 <= z <= 0.5

        but what about the rotations?
        Well, for those of you who haven't learned matrices yet, there's a great math tool called
        a rotation matrix. It lets you rotate a position around the origin counterclockwise by some 
        angle on some axis.

        To use it, we just need to take the three matrices:
        R_x = [1, 0, 0 \ 0, cos(theta), -sin(theta) \ 0, sin(theta), cos(theta)]
        R_y = [cos(theta), 0, sin(theta) \ 0, 1, 0 \ -sin(theta), 0, cos(theta)]
        R_z = [cos(theta), -sin(theta), 0 \ sin(theta), cos(theta), 0 \ 0, 0, 1]

        and multiply our coordinates [x \ y \ z] by them. We need to be careful the order we apply them;
        matrix multiplication is not commutative, meaning order *does* matter. If we do 
        R_z * R_y * R_x * [x \ y \ z]
        for every subsequent rotation, the axes we are rotating around will *also be rotated*. We don't
        want that, so instead we will use
        R_x * R_y * R_z * [x \ y \ z]
        which is an *extrinsic* rotation; one that uses fixed axes. To see why, see here [https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1137745/proof-of-the-extrinsic-to-intrinsic-rotation-transform]
        Now, let's multiply these matrices:
        

        [1, 0, 0 \ 0, cos(theta), -sin(theta) \ 0, sin(theta), cos(theta)][cos(theta), 0, sin(theta) \ 0, 1, 0 \ -sin(theta), 0, cos(theta)][cos(theta), -sin(theta), 0 \ sin(theta), cos(theta), 0 \ 0, 0, 1][x \ y \ z]
        = [xcos^2(theta) - ysin(theta)cos(theta) + zsin(theta) \ x(sin^2(theta)cos(theta)+sin(theta)cos(theta)) + y(cos^2(theta)-sin^3(theta)) - zsin(theta)cos(theta) \ x(sin^2(theta)-sin(theta)cos^2(theta)) + y(sin^2(theta)cos(theta)+sin(theta)cos(theta)) + zcos^2(theta)]

        It's a bit of a beast, but remember that our
        theta is 45 degrees, and that sin(45) = cos(45) = sqrt(2) / 2. Using that property and simplifying
        gives us this final vector:

        = [(x - y + sqrt(2)z) / 2 \ ((2 + sqrt(2))x - (sqrt(2) - 2)y - 2z) / 4 \ (-(sqrt(2) - 2)x + (2 + sqrt(2))y + 2z) / 4]

        So, this tells us that

        x' = (x - y + sqrt(2)z) / 2
        y' = ((2 + sqrt(2))x - (sqrt(2) - 2)y - 2z) / 4
        z' = (-(sqrt(2) - 2)x + (2 + sqrt(2))y + 2z) / 4

        The apostrophe means that those are the rotated positions. So, great! We have the system of
        equations that will give us a position rotated by 45 degrees on each axis. Now, how do we turn
        this into a rotated cube? Try to figure it out, and then scroll down!

        [page break]

        Well, first, look at our earlier inequalities we used to describe a cube:

        -0.5 <= x <= 0.5
        -0.5 <= y <= 0.5
        -0.5 <= z <= 0.5

        What that's saying is that the x, y, and z values have to be between -0.5 and 0.5; this forms
        a cube with side length 1 centered at (0, 0, 0). Great. We already know this. But, what if
        instead, we said this:

        -0.5 <= x' <= 0.5
        -0.5 <= y' <= 0.5
        -0.5 <= z' <= 0.5

        A little weirder, but it still looks right. But think about what it really means; x', y', and z'
        are all defined *in terms of* x, y, and z. This means what we're really solving for is the 
        x, y, and z values which, when rotated by theta, form a normal cube. Understand the
        difference of that and finding the x, y, and z values which form a cube rotated by theta.
        There's a trick to it, though; there's only one cube which, when rotated by theta, is a normal
        cube. It's a cube rotated by -theta. That way, the rotations cancel out and the cube is back
        to where it started. This means that when we set the theta, we're actually rotating the cube
        by -theta.

        ...however, we don't really need to worry about this. Careful readers would have noticed that
        earlier, I said that rotation matrices rotate *counterclockwise*. In reality, we want to
        be rotating clockwise; so, reversing the direction of the rotation is actually correct in this
        case.

        Now, great! We have these inequalities, which create our rotated cube:

        -0.5 <= x' <= 0.5
        -0.5 <= y' <= 0.5
        -0.5 <= z' <= 0.5

        and, let's expand them with our earlier definitions:

        -0.5 <= (x - y + sqrt(2)z) / 2 <= 0.5
        -0.5 <= ((2 + sqrt(2))x - (sqrt(2) - 2)y - 2z) / 4 <= 0.5
        -0.5 <= (-(sqrt(2) - 2)x + (2 + sqrt(2))y + 2z) / 4 <= 0.5

        This is the full system of equations of our rotated cube. Now, how can we find 
        the cross-section of this rotated cube and Oliver's plane (the xy plane)? Try to figure it out, 
        and then scroll down.

        [page break]

        Now, this should feel somewhat familiar; we had the same problem earlier with a normal cube.
        Last time, we just set the z to 0, and this time we want to do something very similar.
        Take a look at the third inequality:

        -0.5 <= (x - y + sqrt(2)z) / 2 <= 0.5
        -0.5 <= ((2 + sqrt(2))x - (sqrt(2) - 2)y - 2z) / 4 <= 0.5
        -0.5 <= (-(sqrt(2) - 2)x + (2 + sqrt(2))y + 2z) / 4 <= 0.5

        remember, that section is equal to z', or the z value of the rotated cube *after it is rotated
        back into a normal cube*. We want to set the z to be 0 when it is still rotated, because that's
        what we're gonna actually see. Clearly, the variable that does that is z. Now, if we say
        
        z = 0,

        -0.5 <= (x - y) / 2 <= 0.5
        -0.5 <= ((2 + sqrt(2))x - (sqrt(2) - 2)y) / 4 <= 0.5
        -0.5 <= (-(sqrt(2) - 2)x + (2 + sqrt(2))y) / 4 <= 0.5

        This is some shape in terms of x and y, which immediately can tell us that it's a shape Oliver
        can see. We could break this down further, but at this point it's easiest to just plot it and
        find out. Let's see!

        [picture of the shape plotted in desmos]

        It looks like some sort of irregular hexagon. Interesting!
        *You could have figured out this would have been some sort of hexagon before we did any math-- for an extra challenge, figure out how!*

        [picture of oliver looking at the weird shape]

        If we shift the shape around on the z-axis, we can see the different sections. You can acheive
        this by adding another term to the equations, to represent the z-shift. We'll call it k.
        In our new system,

        -0.5 <= (x - y + sqrt(2)(z-h)) / 2 <= 0.5
        -0.5 <= ((2 + sqrt(2))x - (sqrt(2) - 2)y - 2(z-h)) / 4 <= 0.5
        -0.5 <= (-(sqrt(2) - 2)x + (2 + sqrt(2))y + 2(z-h)) / 4 <= 0.5

        and with z = 0,

        -0.5 <= (x - y - sqrt(2)h) / 2 <= 0.5
        -0.5 <= ((2 + sqrt(2))x - (sqrt(2) - 2)y + 2h) / 4 <= 0.5
        -0.5 <= (-(sqrt(2) - 2)x + (2 + sqrt(2))y - 2h) / 4 <= 0.5

        try playing around with this in Desmos! This is already a massive block of math so I'm going
        to move onto different stuff now, but have some fun with it! Try looking at different rotations,
        or even different shapes!

    Phew. For anyone who didn't check out the math section, it was a *lot*. But, we're free now!
