    What is the fourth dimension? What does it mean for there to be another?

    First, let's explain what a dimension is. In essence, a dimension is just a direction. Imagine a man living on a line:

    [image here of a stick figure man standing on a line with an arrow in each direction]

    He can move either left or right on the line. We can understand this means he has one direction; the line is one-dimensional. Formally, any position on the line can be described with a single number. We can call that position on the line x.


    Now, imagine we give him a ladder that he can move along his line.

    [image here of the stick figure man saying ‘yay’ with the ladder on the arrow]

    He can now move left and right, and up and down. There are two directions; he can now move two-dimensionally. To describe any one position now, we need two numbers, x like before, as well as a new number y to show his ‘height’ on the ladder.


    This should all feel very familiar, as you’ve seen 2d graphs like this 
    in every math class for as long as you can remember. How does this help 
    us understand 4d objects? Well, consider how Oliver (that’s his name now!) 
    thinks about you. Yes, you! Looking at him on the screen, you're viewing him
    from another direction, which we can call the z axis (an 'axis' just means a direction).
    He can't turn towards the screen, so from his perspective you don't exist. However, what
    happens if you put your hand next to your screen?

    [image here of a hand on the side of a laptop screen, with a picture of stick figure man on it]
    Come on, do it! Really!


    You're not flat, but Oliver can still see the part of your hand that intersects with the area
    he can see, which is the flat plane of the screen. Imagining the intersection of your finger
    and the plane, you can see it's just something like a circle. We call this the cross-section
    of the plane and the finger.

    [image here of the laptop screen being extended to the finger, and the intersecting circle being drawn out]

    Let's say we want to show Oliver what a cube is
    (you could use a more complex shape, but the math will get harder).

    How could we do it? Well, imagine we take a magic floating cube next to the screen. If we
    move it fully from one side to the other, Oliver could see the whole thing, just through the
    individual cross-sections.

    ...but to him, what would it look like? Try to figure it out on your own before continuing.
    [page break here]
    [simulation with a plane and a cube placed towards the screen. there is a slider which controls the cube's z position. the intersection of the two geometries is drawn separately]

    It's a square. It makes sense; the cube is aligned to the plane, so when the cube enters or leaves
    the plane, all levels of the cube at that z-level enter/leave at the same time. Mathematically,
    we can see this by looking at the equation of the cube and plane. If we imagine Oliver's house
    to be the origin (where x, y, and z = 0) and the cube to be a 'unit cube' where 
    the side length = 1, then we can say the plane is defined as
    
    z = 0

    and the cube is defined as
    -0.5 <= x <= 0.5
    -0.5 <= y <= 0.5
    -0.5 <= z <= 0.5

    so, to find the cross-section we can just plug the z value from the first equation to the second:
    
    -0.5 <= x <= 0.5
    -0.5 <= y <= 0.5

    and, this is the equation of a square. Perfect!
    

    Now, let's get back to the point. What is the fourth dimension? First, extend your knowledge
    from the prior exercise to your own world-- the real world. You are Oliver.

    What does that mean? Well, try to imagine our entire universe-- everything, everywhere--
    exists on a flat, three-dimensinoal 'hyperplane' (plane is specific to 2D).
    Now, there are still our three axes (x y and z), but there is also a fourth one, which we
    can call w. As Oliver, you can't turn towards w, but you can still understand it's there
    by extending your knowledge of how a 2D creature might exist in a 3D world.

    But, bad news; the magic floating unit cube is back, and now it has another dimension!
    Now, instead of just being a cube, it's a 4D hypercube, also called a tesseract. Rather than
    a cube, which is made up of six squares, or a square, which is made up of 4 lines, a tesseract
    is made of 8 cubes. 
    
    Do you see the pattern? [on click: try to figure out why. how do you construct a cube from squares, or a square from lines?]

    Mathematically, it can be described as 

    -0.5 <= x <= 0.5
    -0.5 <= y <= 0.5
    -0.5 <= z <= 0.5
    -0.5 <= w <= 0.5

    So... what would you see? What object would appear in front of you as the hypercube moved through
    the w-axis?
    
    [page break here]
    [simulation which shows the intersection of a hypercube and a 3d plane. there is a slider which controls the cube's w position. the intersection of the two geometries is drawn in the center of the screen]

    You probably could've seen this coming, but it's a cube. Setting w to zero with the same logic we used earlier,
    you can see the cross-section is 

    -0.5 <= x <= 0.5
    -0.5 <= y <= 0.5
    -0.5 <= z <= 0.5

    as you can probably tell, this is the equation of a cube. Perfect.


    So, great. We can make cubes appear and disappear. But what about the *fourth dimension*?
    All those cool gifs of weird rotating geometries labeled tesseracts? What about those?

    Well, first let's revisit Oliver.

    [image of Oliver waving hi]

    You might have noticed an issue with our earlier 'simulations' of the intersections.
    It assumes that the cubes are always aligned perfectly with the planes. But, what if that's not the case?

    [image of the cube next to Oliver's plane, now rotated 45 degrees around each axis so one vertex is facing the plane]

    this is the same cube, rotated 45 degrees around each axis. Imagine what Oliver would see now, as the
    plane moves through the z-axis. Try to figure it out, and then test your thoughts:

    [simulation with a plane and the rotated cube placed towards the screen. there is a slider which controls the cube's z position. the intersection of the two geometries is drawn separately]

    first, there is a single point, which grows into a triangle, then grows into a rotated square,
    before shrinking back into a triangle, then to a point, then disappearing.

    Just looking at the shape of the rotated cube, it makes sense; the plane first intersects the tip,
    then intersects along the pyramidical section of the cube, then reaches the very center of the cube which
    is the one part which *is* aligned to the plane, and is therefore a square; and then continues shrinking
    on the other side, which is parallel to the first.

    How about the math, though? [on click:
        first, we know the cube can be represented as 
        
        -0.5 <= x <= 0.5
        -0.5 <= y <= 0.5
        -0.5 <= z <= 0.5

        but what about the rotations?
        Well, for those of you who haven't learned matrices yet, there's a great math tool called
        a rotation matrix. It lets you rotate around a position by some angle on some plane.

        Understanding how they work is out of the scope of this explainer, but to use them shouldn't be too difficult:

        [x, y, z][1, 0, 0 \ 0, cos(45), -sin(45) \ 0, sin(45), cos(45)] = [x, ycos(45) - zsin(45), ysin(45) + zsin(45)]
        [x, ycos(45) - zsin(45), ysin(45) + zsin(45)][cos(45), 0, sin(45) \ 0, 1, 0 \ -sin(45), 0, cos(45)] = 
        [x, y, z][cos(45), -sin(45), 0 \ sin()]

        FINISH TRANSFORMATIONS

        x' = (x + y*(-1 + sqrt(2)/2) + z*(sqrt(2)/2 + 1)) / 2
        y' = (x + y*(sqrt(2)/2 + 1) + z*(-1 + sqrt(2)/2)) / 2
        z' = (-sqrt(2)*x + y + z) / 2

        so, these coordinates tell us the x y and z positions after they have been rotated. We
        also still know the following equality:

        -0.5 <= x <= 0.5
        -0.5 <= y <= 0.5
        -0.5 <= z <= 0.5

        and, we want to find when the rotated cube intersects the xy plane, when z' = 0, so

        0 = (-sqrt(2)*x + y + z) / 2

        we can find an equation for the z-value by using this constraint:

        0 = (-sqrt(2)*x + y + z) / 2
        0 = -sqrt(2)*x + y + z
        -z = -sqrt(2)*x + y
        z = sqrt(2)*x - y


        







        Now, let's look back at our inequalities. Look at the z inequality:

        -0.5 <= z <= 0.5

        makes sense, but remember that we want to display the cube rotating *next* to the plane,
        not in the plane. Right now, it's centered at 0. To change this, let's just add one more
        variable, c_z, to represent the z value of the center. Our inequality will now look like

        -0.5 + c_z <= z <= 0.5 + c_z

        and, combining this with our z definition, we can see

        -0.5 + c_z <= sqrt(2)*x - y <= 0.5 + c_z

        this can be rearranged into two inequalities in terms of y:

        y >= sqrt(2)*x - 0.5 - c_z
        y <= sqrt(2)*x + 0.5 - c_z

        perfect! Now, this tells us the unrotated domain of the cube. How does this help us,
        anyway? Well, to see what Oliver sees, we need to be able to analyze the domain of the
        cross-section of the rotated cube and the plane. For that to be the case, we need to be
        able to view the system of equations of the intersection in terms of only x and y.
        We *can* remove the z-value, by just testing it at different constant values. We know
        from our ealier analysis the different sections of the cross-section that appear when
        shifting the z-value, so we can just make some educated guesses here. First, let's look
        at when the center of the cube is the furthest it can be from the plane while still 
        touching:
        
        z = 1




        We can find this by combining the new definition of z and the earlier system of equations:

        x' = (x + y*(-1 + sqrt(2)/2) + z*(sqrt(2)/2 + 1)) / 2
        = (x + y*(-1 + sqrt(2)/2) + (sqrt(2)*x - y)*(sqrt(2)/2 + 1)) / 2
        = (x*sqrt(2) * (1+sqrt(2)) - 2y) / 2
        = (sqrt(2) * (x(1+sqrt(2)) - y*sqrt(2))) / 2

        = (x(1+sqrt(2)) - y*sqrt(2)) / sqrt(2)
        y' = (x(-1+sqrt(2)) + y*sqrt(2)) / sqrt(2)
        z' = 0 (obviously)

        Great! Now
